# Linear Regression Algorithm from Scratch

## Overview

This Python project implements a basic linear regression algorithm from scratch. Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Features

- Simple linear regression with one independent variable.
- Implementation of the least squares method for parameter estimation.
- Visualization of the regression line and data points.


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
